# Example electron app with spectron for UI tests

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Run e2e tests with Spectron and Puppeteer simultaneously
```
npm test
```

## Run e2e tests headless
```
npm run test:headless
```

P.S. Spectron has been deprecated not longer after I had made this POC for work. RIP Spectron
